WILL JSON DATA BE LOST WHEN YOU DEPLOY AGAIN?
================================================================================

ANSWER: NO - Your JSON data will NOT be lost ✅

================================================================================
WHY DATA IS SAFE
================================================================================

1. DATA STORAGE LOCATION:
   - Your JSON is stored in: Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
   - Bucket: image_labeling
   - Path: analytics-data/image_analytics_data.json
   - GCS is COMPLETELY SEPARATE from Vercel

2. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DEPLOY:
   - Vercel deploys your application code only
   - Frontend React app
   - Backend API functions
   - Configuration files
   - DOES NOT touch GCS data

3. GCS IS INDEPENDENT:
   - GCS is Google's cloud storage service
   - It's not part of Vercel
   - Your data lives in Google's servers
   - Vercel deployment cannot delete or modify GCS data
   - Only your application code can read/write to GCS

================================================================================
WHAT CHANGES WHEN YOU DEPLOY
================================================================================

✅ WILL CHANGE:
   - Application code (React components, API functions)
   - Frontend UI
   - Backend logic
   - Configuration

❌ WILL NOT CHANGE:
   - GCS JSON data
   - Images in GCS
   - Any data in Google Cloud Storage
   - Existing analytics/labels

================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
  GCS: [Your JSON data] ← Application reads/writes this
  Vercel: [Old code]

AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
  GCS: [Your JSON data] ← STILL THERE, unchanged
  Vercel: [New code] ← Updated, but still connects to same GCS

The application code is just the "interface" to your data.
Changing the interface doesn't affect the data itself.

================================================================================
ONLY WAY DATA CAN BE LOST
================================================================================

Data can ONLY be lost if:
1. ❌ Application code has bug that saves empty/wrong data
2. ❌ Multiple users overwrite each other (race condition)
3. ❌ Manual deletion in GCS Console
4. ❌ GCS bucket is deleted
5. ❌ GCS credentials are revoked

NOT from:
✅ Deploying new code
✅ Updating application
✅ Changing Vercel settings
✅ Redeploying

================================================================================
BEST PRACTICE
================================================================================

Before deploying major changes:
1. ✅ Download current JSON as backup
2. ✅ Enable GCS versioning (you already did this)
3. ✅ Test changes locally first
4. ✅ Deploy with confidence - data is safe

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

Q: If I change code and deploy again, will JSON data be lost?
A: NO - Your data in GCS is completely safe.

GCS is separate from Vercel. Deployment only updates your application,
not your data storage.
