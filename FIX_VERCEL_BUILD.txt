VERCEL BUILD ERROR FIX
=====================

Error: "cd react-app: No such file or directory"

CAUSE: You uploaded react-app contents directly to GitHub root.
Vercel is trying to cd into react-app subfolder that doesn't exist.

FIX IN VERCEL:
==============

1. Go to Vercel Project Settings
2. Click "General" or "Build & Development Settings"
3. Update these settings:

   Root Directory: (leave EMPTY or set to "/")
   
   Build Command: npm install && npm run build
   
   Output Directory: dist
   
   Install Command: npm install

4. Save settings
5. Redeploy

The root directory MUST be empty since your files are at repo root, not in a subfolder.
